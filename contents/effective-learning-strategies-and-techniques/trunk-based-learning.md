# Trunk Based Learning

:::note
"Trunk Based Learning is a learning strategy that focuses on the core concepts of a subject before diving into the details." - Scott Young
:::

- Advocates for a focus on the core concepts of a subject before diving into the details.
- Emphasizes the value of a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, which can be built upon with more advanced concepts.
- Encourages learners to prioritize the most important concepts and skills, rather than getting lost in the details.
- We live in a world that knowledge is constantly changing and evolving. So it's important to have a strong foundation of knowledge rather than trying to learn everything.
