# Interleaving

Interleaving is a learning technique that involves mixing different topics or forms of practice in order to facilitate learning. Unlike blocked practice, where one focuses on a single topic or skill before moving to another, interleaving entails switching between different topics or types of problems during a single study session.

## How It Works

- **Variation in Practice**: Instead of practicing one skill at a time, you mix various skills or subjects within the same study period.
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills**: By interleaving different topics, learners are challenged to constantly adapt and apply different strategies, enhancing their problem-solving abilities.
- **Better Preparation for Testing**: This method mimics the unpredictable nature of real-world scenarios and exams, where different types of problems or questions are encountered in a random order.

## Benefits

- **Improves Memory Retention**: Interleaving strengthens memory and aids in long-term retention of material.
- **Facilitates Deeper Learning**: It encourages deeper understanding as learners must constantly switch gears and apply different concepts or methods.
- **Reduces Boredom**: By varying topics, interleaving keeps study sessions fresh and engaging.

## Incorporating Interleaving into Learning

- **Mix Subjects or Concepts**: When studying, switch between different subjects or concepts at regular intervals.
- **Apply to Different Skills**: This technique is not limited to theoretical knowledge; it can be applied to skills such as musical instruments, sports, or art.
- **Use with Spaced Repetition**: Combine interleaving with spaced repetition for optimal learning efficiency.

## Conclusion

Interleaving is a powerful approach to learning that challenges the traditional methods of mastering one topic before moving to the next. By incorporating variety and complexity into study sessions, interleaving helps build a more robust understanding and retention of the material, preparing learners for the unpredictability of real-life applications and assessments.
