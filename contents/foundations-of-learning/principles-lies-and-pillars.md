### Compound learning

:::note
"Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you’re twice as good. - Alan Weiss, Ph. D"
:::

- The principle of compound learning is that small, incremental improvements can lead to significant progress over time.
- Advocates for a steady, incremental approach to skill acquisition and knowledge enhancement.
- Emphasizes the value of consistency and persistence in learning.

### Skill staking

:::note
"The more skills you have, the more valuable you are. - Scott Adams”
:::

- The principle of skill stacking is that combining multiple skills can lead to unique and valuable combinations.
- Advocates for the development of a diverse skill set that can be applied to a variety of contexts.
- Emphasizes the value of interdisciplinary learning and the ability to adapt to new situations.

### Metalearning

:::note
"Metalearning is the process of learning how to learn." - Scott Young
:::

- Metalearning is the process of learning how to learn.
- Advocates for a proactive approach to learning, which involves setting specific goals, receiving feedback, and making adjustments.
- Emphasizes the value of self-awareness and self-reflection in the learning process.

## Lies

### Follow your passion

:::note
"Follow your passion" is dangerous advice. It suggests that there's a perfect match out there waiting for you. And if you find it, everything will be great. But if you don't, you'll never be happy. It's a destructive myth. - Cal Newport - So Good They Can't Ignore You.
:::

Following your passion is a lie that's been told to us by our parents, our teachers, our mentors, and our peers, the media, by our culture, and by our society. Don't get me wrong, everyone has a passion but in terms of being an effective learner, you could be really good at something that is not really your passion.

#### Recommendations

- Challenge the conventional advice of blindly following your passion for career or learning decisions.
- Consider that your passion can be developed and nurtured through competence and mastery, not just inherent interest.
- Emphasize the need for a balance between your passion and practicality, advocating for skills and knowledge that are in demand and personally satisfying.

### 10,000 hours rule

:::note
"The 10,000-hour rule is a lie. It's not a magic number that you can apply to any skill or any person." - Scott Young
:::

In 1993 a study was published by Anders Ericsson, Ralf Krampe, and Clemens Tesch-Romer called "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance". The study was about violinists at the Berlin Academy of Music. The study found that the best violinists had practiced for 10,000 hours by the age of 20. The study was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book "Outliers" and the 10,000 hours rule was born. The issue with this metric of 10,000 in the learning context is that it's not a one size fits all. It's not a magic number that you can apply to any skill or any person. It's a very specific number that applies to a very specific group of people.

#### Recommendations

- Everyone has advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to consider your unique circumstances when setting goals.
- Focus on the quality of your practice, not just the quantity.
- Consider the value of deliberate practice but being an efficient learner, which involves setting specific goals, receiving feedback, and making adjustments.

## Pillars

### Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset

:::note
"In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort. They’re wrong. In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment." - Carol Dweck

:::

- Emphasizes a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset, advocating the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
- Encourages viewing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than obstacles.
- Promotes the idea of 'trainability' in all aspects of life, urging individuals to adopt a proactive approach to learning and self-improvement.
- Understand the "Locus of control" as a concept in psychology that refers to the extent to which individuals believe they can control events that affect them.

### Simplicity vs Complexity

:::note
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein
:::

- Emphasizes the value of simplicity in learning, advocating for clear, concise, and straightforward explanations.
- Encourages the use of simple, easy-to-understand language and concepts.
- Promotes the idea that simplicity is not the same as oversimplification, and that complex topics can be explained in simple terms.

### Trunk Based Learning

:::note
"Trunk Based Learning is a learning strategy that focuses on the core concepts of a subject before diving into the details." - Scott Young
:::

- Advocates for a focus on the core concepts of a subject before diving into the details.
- Emphasizes the value of a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, which can be built upon with more advanced concepts.
- Encourages learners to prioritize the most important concepts and skills, rather than getting lost in the details.
- We live in a world that knowledge is constantly changing and evolving. So it's important to have a strong foundation of knowledge rather than trying to learn everything.
